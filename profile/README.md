## Overview

This is a capstone project for the [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/), University of California, Santa Barbara

## Project Summary

In December 2022, Equinor, Golden State Wind, and Even Keel Energy (Invenergy) won the rights to develop offshore wind farms off the coast of San Luis Obispo County. The clean energy output could power 3.5 million homes, marking a significant step towards California’s carbon neutrality goals. It will also lead to the creation of a new economy around clean energy in the region. At the same time, the Central Coast stands to lose reliable, unionized fossil fuel jobs as the region shifts to a decarbonized energy supply. To this end, these three companies have committed $27 million for community benefits and an additional $66 million for local workforce and supply chain development. Community organizers are in need of up-to-date information to ensure that this funding benefits the maximum number of residents; that people from the most disadvantaged communities can access clean energy jobs; and that the new jobs provide great benefits. Estimates of where, how many, and what type of energy jobs will be gained and lost during this transition will inform these conversations and decisions. 

In partnership with the [2035 Initiative](https://www.2035initiative.com) and the [UCSB Community Labor Project](https://www.blumcenter.ucsb.edu/initiatives/ccrei), we built a model that estimates the economic impacts of several clean energy transition scenarios. This model incorporates local economic data from the economic development software [IMPLAN](https://blog.implan.com/what-is-implan), outputs from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s [Jobs and Economic Development Impact (JEDI) model](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jedi+model&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), and data from and imperical model developed by [Deshmukh *et. al.*](https://asu.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/equitable-low-carbon-transition-pathways-for-californias-oil-extr) to project job growth or loss from floating offshore wind, utility and rooftop solar, onshore wind, onshore oil well capping, and fossil fuel phaseout. 

These projections are visualized in an interactive dashboard that users can navigate to understand the likely impacts of the clean energy transition across Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties. We aim to design our analysis for labor, indigenous, environmental, and community organizations to inform the conversation about offshore wind and other renewable energy jobs, to advocate with and on behalf of fossil fuel workers for a “just transition”, and to serve as a model for how research can support just transitions in energy communities across the United States.

## Objectives 

The project objectives are:

1. Quantify the number of jobs created from reaching defined state goals for floating offshore wind, utility and rooftop solar, onshore wind, and onshore oil well phase out in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties. 
2. Create a tool that will project number of jobs created under any given capacity deployment goals, allowing for flexibility under an uncertain energy climate.
3. Fill in knowledge gaps for community organizers and clean energy advocates about how to ensure a just transition for fossil fuel workers.
